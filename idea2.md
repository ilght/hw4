Breakout clone
  Paying homages to the Breakout clone, but this time no longer will be a lame ball, it will be the head of senpai to hit 
the block and gain points. The blocks are hard and your senpai is very sensitive, and he will scream each time the user hit
the block. There will be a line or a bar the user can use it to bouncing off the senpai's head which is his favorite. 
  The block will appear on the screen randomly, And the number of blocks will increase stage by stages. And you have to 
prevent senpai flying to the out frame. And your senpai's head will accelerate by the time you are playing. Plz, Don't let 
your senpai unhappy, make sure for each bouncing you will hit one block.
